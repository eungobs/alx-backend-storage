Stored Procedure
Triggers
Views
Functions and Operators
Trigger Syntax and Examples


Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

How to create tables with constraints
Techniques for optimizing queries using indexes
Implementation of stored procedures and functions in MySQL
Creation and utilization of views
Implementation of triggers in MySQL
Requirements
All files to be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using MySQL 5.7 (version 5.7.30)
SQL queries to have comments just before them
Files should start with a comment describing the task
All SQL keywords to be in uppercase

Instructions
Clone the project repository.

Use "container-on-demand" to run MySQL for testing purposes.
Read or watch the provided resources to familiarize yourself with advanced SQL concepts.
Start solving the tasks listed in the project description.
Write SQL scripts for each task, following the provided requirements.
Test your scripts by executing them on the MySQL server.
Verify the output of your scripts and make any necessary adjustments.
Update the README.md file with any additional information or instructions.
Ensure all files end with a new line and follow the specified conventions.
Running SQL Scripts
To execute SQL scripts on the MySQL server, you can use the following command:

cat script_name.sql | mysql -uroot -p database_name
Project Structure
Each task has its own SQL file named according to the task number.
The README.md file provides instructions and details about the project.
Additional resources and information are provided in the project directory.
Project Completion
Once you have completed all tasks and tested your SQL scripts successfully, you can submit your project for review.

Note: Ensure your scripts meet all the requirements and produce the expected output. Make use of comments to explain your code and follow best practices for SQL development.
